Mix 1 tsp of the salt and 1 tsp of the ground turmeric, rub on all sides of the fish and set aside for 30 minutes,In a shallow saucepan, heat 5 tbsp of the oil over a medium-high heat. If you are using mustard oil, heat until it is smoking hot – this removes the bitter pungency of the oil – then bring it down to a medium-high heat. Add the fish to the pan and fry to seal each piece, but do not let the fillets cook through. Remove from the pan to a plate and set aside,Gently return the fish fillets to the pan and cover with the sauce, ensuring all sides of each fillet are cooking evenly. If possible, cook the fish fillets in a single layer in the pan as this will prevent them from breaking up into flakes. Lower the heat, add the sugar and cook, covered, until the fillets are cooked through – this should take no longer than 5 minutes,To serve, garnish the fish with whole green chillies and sprigs of fresh coriander leaves",
